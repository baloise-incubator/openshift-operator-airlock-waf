== workflow(s)

== required metadata

We've discussed two ideas

- defining a https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/[CustomResourceDefinitions (CRD)] and listend for change events here
- listening for e.g. route (/ ingress) change events and annotation the e.g. route with required information to create / update / maintain a WAF mapping

| Strengths 
| Weaknesses

| based on Spring

based on manufacturer know-how

modularized

| partially reliant on internal / binary resources

| *Opportunities*
| *Threats*

| (distributed) maintenance (e.g. by manufacturer) in future
| upstream project direction no longer aligned with internal requirements

mitigation: *fork and maintain on our own*

== approach 2 

=== idea

champion: build our own (lightweight) solution based on Quarkus and the Fabric8 Java Kubernetes client API.
