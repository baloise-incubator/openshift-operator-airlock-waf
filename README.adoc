=== ideas

We've discussed two ideas

- defining a https://docs.okd.io/3.11/admin_guide/custom_resource_definitions.html[CustomResourceDefinitions (CRD)] and listend for change events here
- listening for e.g. route - see https://docs.okd.io/3.11/architecture/networking/routes.html[architecture] and https://docs.okd.io/3.11/rest_api/route_openshift_io/route-route-openshift-io-v1.html[API] - change events and https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/[annotation] the e.g. route with required information to create / update / maintain a WAF mapping

For now we go with the second approach.

=== required WAF information

Mapping:

- Name
- (entryPath)
- (backendPath)

BackendGroup:

- Name

Backend (x):

- Name
- Protocol
- Port

VHost

- Name

=== WAF -> OpenShift attribute & annotation mapping

metadata: {
  ergon.ch/waf-mapping: { # <1>
    key1 : "value1", # <2>
    key2 : "value2" # <3>
  }
}
----
<1> annotation itself

<3> property 2

| Strengths 
| Weaknesses

| based on Spring

based on manufacturer know-how

modularized

in sync with manufacturer (API) changes

| partially reliant on internal / binary resources

| *Opportunities*
| *Threats*

| (distributed) maintenance (e.g. by manufacturer) in future
| upstream project direction no longer aligned with internal requirements

mitigation: *fork and maintain on our own*
|===

== approach 2 

=== idea

champion: build our own (lightweight) solution based on Quarkus and the Fabric8 Java Kubernetes client API.

|===
| Strengths 
| Weaknesses

| potentially lightweight

exactly what we need

| offset to manufacturer (API) changes

(new) use cases must be implemented and maintained by our own

| *Opportunities*
| *Threats*

| exemplify new technology within small and well defined scope
| new framework technology without TIP & supporter

mitigation: *find supporter and file TIP*

incompatible (API) changes by manufacturer

mitigation: *make open-source and inform manufacturer about it*
